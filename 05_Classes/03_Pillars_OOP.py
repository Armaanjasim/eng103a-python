# 4 Pillars

# Abstraction
# providing easy methods to interact. logic is hidden

# Encapsulation
# important stuff is hidden from the user and complicated stuff, so they can change anything crucial

# Inheritance
# You can make a new class from the previous class with the same properties and add on it

# Polymorphism
# Changes to the current method which overrides
